The website for Urbit is maintained by the Urbit Foundation and the Urbit community. Issues and contributions are welcome.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the [Urbit site repository](https://github.com/urbit/urbit.org).

2. [Create a local clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) of your fork.

    You can then run `nvm use` whenever in the repository (or automate it with a script - see [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#deeper-shell-integration)).

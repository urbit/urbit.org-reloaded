One challenge decentralized networks face is that there’s no central place to discover new software or content. The Urbit Foundation’s Urbit Labs team has designed an app, Hits, to solve this problem. 

You can think of Hits as an app store plus a social graph rolled into one. Leveraging the [Pals app](/ecosystem/apps/pals), hits ranks apps based on what your Urbit friends have installed. There’s even a trending tab to find the hottest apps of the moment.

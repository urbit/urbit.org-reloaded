Syndicates are portable digital organizations designed for 'network tribes' that value decentralization, personal sovereignty, and collective innovation. Through a combination of onchain digital assets and tools, along with off-chain software running over a peer-to-peer and end-to-end encrypted network, Syndicates are able to operate as self-sovereign socioeconomic networks, both onchain and off-chain. ~tocwex.syndicate is a practice in recursive creation of syndicate tooling.

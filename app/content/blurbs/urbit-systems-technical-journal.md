The Urbit Systems Technical Journal (USTJ) publishes articles on the ongoing development of Urbit and on solid-state computing more generally. Like the famous Bell Labs Technical Journal on which it is modeled, the Urbit Systems Technical Journal aims to document the engineering work necessary to realize the vision of computing as sovereign, deterministic, and grounded on solid first principles.

In so doing, the USTJ hopes that these technical problems come to interest and benefit the broader developer community. Functional (as in programming) engineers are often on the leading edge of software development, and the solutions they undertake have required large-scale innovations in the field of computer science generally.

The Urbit community is currently engaged in such endeavors, such as the Neo Urbit project to increase data storage and execution speed of Urbit's low-level interpreted language Nock. USTJ showcases advancements in dynamic linking, floating-point calculation, and memory management systems. The USTJ editors welcomes submissions from those engaged in making computing more solid-state; if you wish to contribute a technical article, please reach out to `~lagrev-nocfep`.

Your urbit is intended to run as a 'personal server': an always-on networked computer. One way to do this is to offload the task of running hardware while you manage the software and retain cryptographic control over your urbit's self-sovereign identity. 

Running urbit in a datacenter offers benefits around remote access, network reliability, and protections against power failures. If you are already familiar with running cloud services, running urbit is easier then just about anything else out there—and wildly more portable.

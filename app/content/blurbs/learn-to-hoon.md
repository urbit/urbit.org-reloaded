Urbit's nature as a full rewrite of the networked computing stack and functional operating system also means that it has it's own functional programming language, Hoon. Often described as the synonym, `Assembly:C::Nock:Hoon`, Hoon is designed as a human readable systems programming language. 

While some consider it's 'runic' syntax too esoteric, many Urbit contributors learned Hoon as their first programming language, and it may be fair to consider it an infohazard as there are many people who, after writing lots of Hoon, proceed to refuse to write JavaScript ever again.

Materials are available in various formats, including a [video lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAvwkdfME3E&list=PLYGEMSwLguIEivFINNsHIsi0AbieRZIdk&index=8), [a written Hoon School curriculum](https://docs.urbit.org/build-on-urbit/hoon-school), and [extensive technical documentation](https://docs.urbit.org/hoon/why-hoon). 

You are also invited to [read the source](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/master/pkg/arvo/sys/hoon.hoon), to understand how Hoon builds itself up from raw Nock.

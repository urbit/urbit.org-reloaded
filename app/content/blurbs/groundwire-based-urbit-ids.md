Currently under development and not yet available for usage on Urbit's mainnet, Groundwire is the segment of Urbit address space registered and owned on the Bitcoin blockchain as ordinal / inscription-based Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). Groundwire identities can be independently generated by users without dependencies on an existing network hierarchy, and use L1 Bitcoin fees as their method of spam resistance, in contrast to Azimuth's 'premined' ownership and finite address space.

Join the Groundwire group on Tlon Messenger for the most up to date news about getting an Urbit ID on Bitcoin.

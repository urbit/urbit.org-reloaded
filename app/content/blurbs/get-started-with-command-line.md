The most fundamental way to run urbit is from the command line of a Unix-like host operating system. If you are comfortable running a few commands in your computer's terminal, you can get up and running with your own self-hosted urbit in minutes without the need for additional hardware or subscription services. 

You will need to [get an Urbit ID](/overview/running-urbit/get-urbit-id), or start with a free, ephemeral comet identity, but starting on the command line will help you understand the core basics of running urbit.

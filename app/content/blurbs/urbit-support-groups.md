Urbit is real, which means most discussion about improving Urbit happens on Urbit. Once you have bootstrapped a peer-to-peer operating system that really feels like it is yours, it's hard to go back.

The following groups on Tlon Messenger are common locations to get support:
- [Tlon Local](https://join.tlon.io/0v3.sduc6.0cd2e.epbcp.8fo79.804i2) `~nibset-napwyn/tlon` : Tlon's primary group, good for getting support with Tlon Messenger specifically, or help with a Tlon hosted ship.
- [\[battery payload\]](https://join.tlon.io/0v1.thdiu.q9kem.a0gtu.438pi.544q5) `~dister-dozzod-lapdeg/battery-payload` : The primary developer discussion community, good for deeply technical questions and developers learning the urbit stack
- [Hooniverse](https://join.tlon.io/0v4.08nc4.9dpsf.cn0bg.oo2if.19vh8) `~hiddev-dannut/new-hooniverse` : Primary channel for Hoon School learning cohorts, good additional resource for Hoon language learning in particular
- [Urbit Community](https://join.tlon.io/0v5.hgh0j.2h66k.lj96t.7vk5k.27d9o) `~bitbet-bolbel/urbit-community` : An open community hub with a "Help" channel where basic questions get answered quickly by community members
- [Urbit Foundation](https://join.tlon.io/0v7.m3p2b.iraia.rsse5.p36j3.ggbk8) `~halbex-palheb/uf-public` : The Urbit Foundation's public group, with knowledgable members who can help point you in the right direction for whatever you are trying to find.

All of these groups are open and public, so if for some reason, you are having issues with even getting on the network, just [get the appropriate urbit runtime for your computer](https://docs.urbit.org/get-on-urbit#get-the-urbit-runtime) and boot an ephemeral comet identity by running:
```
./urbit -c support-comet
```

and going to `https://localhost:80/apps/groups` in your browser, select 'join a group' and enter the reference code above. Clicking any of the above links also should help route you into the groups if you have a running ship. And if you don't it will even give you a free Tlon hosted planet Still having issues?

The primary way to acquire a persistent identity on the Urbit network is via a planet-level identity. A "planet" has a 4 syllable handle, or `@p`, like `~sampel-palnet` and is owned on the Ethereum network as a ERC-721 NFT or via Urbit's Layer 2, the "Naive Rollup".

Because Urbit ID is a decentralized and cryptographically-owned address space, any number of providers can offer for sale either a Layer 1 or Layer 2 identity, whether with crypto or fiat. There are also organizations (such as Tlon Corporation) which will give you a free identity as a part of signing up with their service, although that typically doesn't allow you chose a specific `@p` or sigil. 

Aside from planet-level identities, there are also stars and galaxies which are key parts of Azimuth's networking hierarchy. But, if you are just getting started, we recommend a planet as it is reasonable in cost (~$0-100 depending on how fancy of a `@p` you want), and will do everything you need to get started on Urbit.

Below are a few options for where to buy a planet:

- [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/urbit-id) - An NFT Marketplace that supports trading Layer 1 Urbit IDs
- [subject.network](https://subject.network/buy/) - Buy a Layer 2 planet with bitcoin
- [~pocwet](https://store.pocwet.com/) - Buy a Layer 2 planet with a credit card

In the near future, additional identity options will be available, such as comet-attestation on Bitcoin.

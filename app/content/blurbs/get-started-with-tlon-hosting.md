Tlon Corporation offers free and seamless hosting for your urbit with specific care taken towards a smooth onboarding experience to Tlon Messenger, Urbit's most widely used application.

If you are looking to get on the network and have Tlon host your urbit ship, rather than [self-hosting it yourself](/overview/running-urbit/run-urbit-os), their mobile friendly onboarding flow takes seconds and allows you to sign up with a phone number or email—no need to deal with crypto wallets until you are ready.

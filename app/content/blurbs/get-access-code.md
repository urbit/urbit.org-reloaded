```
+code
```

Your `+code` is used for access to your urbit, generally via web interfaces and mobile clients. Some application providers call it a "luscode", while others call it an "access code". It is an eight-syllable phenome, like `~ropnys-batwyd-nossyt-mapwet`. Not to be confused with a master-ticket.

Part of that means a being a networked computer that can be run by it's users. That said, Urbit is still under active development, so self-hosting is currently most apt for users who aren't afraid of a little bit of tinkering. If that's not you, we recommend using a hosting provider instead."

Urbit is designed to be run by its users. Self-hosting is the way to get the most complete Urbit experience, giving you full control over your personal server.

While Urbit aims to be as simple as caring for a cactus, it does come with the responsibility of knowing how to boot, run, and maintain your instance. Choose from multiple self-hosting options below based on your technical comfort level and requirements.

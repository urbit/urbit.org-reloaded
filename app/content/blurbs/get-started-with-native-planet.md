Native Planet hardware devices are our recommended way of running your urbit. Specifically optimized for running Urbit OS, they come preloaded with Groundseg, an open source software program designed for running and managing Urbit nodes. 

Along with their Startram service, running your urbit on a Native Planet device gives you the ideal balance of local control of data, low maintenance operation, and streamlined remote access. You can even get started on the command line today, and then easily import your urbit when your device arrives.

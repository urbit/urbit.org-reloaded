While you will tend to get the quickest responses about running urbit *on urbit*, that can present a catch-22 in the event you can't get on the network in the first place. Here are a few options for reaching out to get help getting on the network:

- Issues with running `urbit` itself? Send a email to [support@urbit.org](mailto:support@urbit.org), or [log an issue on github](https://github.com/urbit/urbit)
- Issues with Tlon Messenger? Send an email to [support@tlon.io](mailto:support@urbit.org)

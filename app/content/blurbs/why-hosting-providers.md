Urbit is intended to be 'your personal server'. Your own always-on, networked computer that is so simple it is as easy to run as caring for a cactus. If this is true, why are there companies that provide hosting as a service? Presently it is for two core reasons:

1. Urbit is still being built. Running it on your own isn't *quite* as easy as caring for a cactus, *yet*. In our experience, it is still a task for a quasi-technical user, but it is easier than self-hosting just about any other self-sovereign computing process (e.g. running a Mattermost instance or a Nostr relay). That said, if you can run one urbit for yourself, it's trivially easy to run a few more for your friends (especially using something like [Groundseg](https://manual.groundseg.app/)). But hosting providers generally make the invite and onboarding process easier, and will handle maintenance and customer support as well.
2. Frankly, not everyone cares about owning their own data or identity, but networks effects matter. Unique to Urbit is it's ability to fully cater to both the hyper-privacy aware, and the totally aloof. Imagine if you could have a Facebook account, but which wasn't under the control of Meta. Your grandmother can have her easily accessed farmville account and 'pay' for it with her attention being sold to advertisers, while you get to keep your experience free from the attention economy. All while getting to be full participants in the same network.

We intend Urbit to be for everyone, and so while the current experience is focused towards developers and power users, hosting providers are a key element in the journey to bring Urbit to everyone.

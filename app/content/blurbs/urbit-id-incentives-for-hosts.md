In the world of MEGACORP SaaS services, you are wholly subject to the whims of your service provider. They chose what version of the software you run, who you can connect with, and whether or not you even exist. As in, if you have an identity in the first place. With Urbit, the paradigm shifts and a better solution to the principal-agent problem presents itself. In separating out ownership and control of both the Urbit OS and Urbit ID, it becomes easy to place the locus of control back in the hands of the user. 

This shift modifies the relationship between hosting provider and user in a few ways:
- The user cryptographically owns their identity. At any moment, the user can declare to the entire rest of the network, "That instance of Urbit OS claiming to be me, *is not me!*"
- The user can then spin up a new instance of Urbit OS with a verifiable claim of "This is truly me" and override the claims of a malevolent host
- Because the user always owns their identity, a hosting provider cannot 'unperson' their users (and silence any dissent about the quality of their service in the process)

All of this means that there is a stronger incentive for a hosting provider to behave as a honest actor, serving the interests of their users as the principal in the relationship, rather than bending towards extractive behavior. Pair this with the portable nature of Urbit OS and watch as the incentives that turn basically every piece of modern software into tools of surveillance capitalism or the attention economy fade away and your computing experience feels like it is *yours* again.

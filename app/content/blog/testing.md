1. While it’s been a difficult process, the outcome of the board and senate actions have clarified Urbit’s situation and cleared the ground for progress and success in the future. In particular, they have highlighted how core development is distinct from product development and the importance of the Urbit Foundation (UF) being clear and focused on its mission. The new arrangement sets up both for future investment, which benefits the ecosystem.

2. The (UF) will spin out a new for-profit entity, Hidden Tiger, designed to build user traction for Urbit. In the immediate run, Hidden Tiger will contract with UF to employ present developers on present projects. Generally, these developers will be offered employment at Hidden Tiger, which will be headed by ~sorreg-namtyv and ~radnep-bolled.

The UF will focus on core development, in partnership with the Guild. Its aspirational mandate will be working towards Kelvin 0 while never breaking userspace. It will be led by ~sicdev-pilnup as interim ED. A new consensus board will be named no later than November 2025.

We hope this new arrangement will enable the UF to pursue its longstanding mission, Hidden Tiger to pursue traction and re-ignite broader interest in Urbit, and the developer community to pursue its work on Arvo without distraction.

We thank the board for their leadership. We thank ~master-malwyl for his hard work and passion, and look forward to his contributions to the Urbit ecosystem. We thank A16Z for its support and tireless diplomacy. We thank the Senate for its wisdom and the Urbit community for its energy and loyalty. It’s become clear that community governance is the future of Urbit.

3. The Plan: Currently, the UF has approximately $3M, which gives it 24 months of runway. To kickstart demand for Arvo and Azimuth by sponsoring a general-purpose front end bundled with an end-to-end user experience, the UF will invest ~$2M (66%) of its current cash, and 510 stars, in Hidden Tiger, leaving both organizations with 24 months of runway. This maintains the status quo.  UF will also transfer all rights to the urbit.box domain and the urbit.eth ENS domain.

In return, UF will receive ~15% of the common equity in Hidden Tiger. Note:

a) Core development currently accounts for a third of the UF’s expenditures, and we are making no change to that.
b) This leaves both core development and traction projects funded at the same level they are now, with the same runway 
c) This values stars at the recent a16z price, which valued the namespace at $150M.
d) Hidden Tiger will use ~300 of its own stars to buy Red Horizon from Chorus One.

In addition, ~sorreg-namtyv will grant Hidden Tiger a perpetual call option, at the A16Z price, on 1020 stars of his own. Hidden Tiger will also seek additional funding.

4. Hidden Tiger will be responsible for developing Urbit fungible planet and star tokens, using the Urbit brand, reviewed with the UF and Tlon. Other new Azimuth-related blockchain work includes: a planet dispenser; some conventions for the claims contracts; and bridges to Bitcoin/Groundwire, Hyperliquid, Base, the Tlon rollup L2, etc. Any changes to the Ecliptic contracts will be developed by Hidden Tiger, reviewed with the UF and Tlon, and approved by the Senate.

5. Tlon, which holds the Urbit trademark, will grant the UF a perpetual license to use it, and permission to transfer it whenever the UF can afford the costs.

6. This has been a hard year for Urbit–but hardly its hardest. And it’s been truly inspiring to see how much people care about this project and the future it’s aimed at. Our job is to set up a stable and productive structure which channels the community’s energy into creating that future.

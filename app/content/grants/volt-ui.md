## Project Description

Build a user-interface that interacts with urbit's lightning wallet (Volt).

This will be a solo project with ~dasrun-fadben.

The project will involve:
- creating a gall agent that serves the user interface
- integrating with the volt agent
- adding any necessary elements to the volt interface

## Prerequisites

Experience with front-end web-development is required, and some familiarity with Hoon would be useful.

## Time Estimate

4-6 weeks working approximately 10 hours a week.

## Deliverables

The core deliverable is a lightning wallet user-interface, bundled together with
volt as an application.

From the lightning wallet app, the user will be able to:
- Select a volt-provider node
- Manage channels with their provider
- Generate payment invoices
- Pay invoices
- View payment status & history

A PR should be made to github.com/dasrun-fadben/volt.git

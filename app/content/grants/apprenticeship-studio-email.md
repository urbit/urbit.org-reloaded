## Project Description

The goal will be to build out the email capabilities of the studio mailer app. Currently it allows sending one-off emails and subscription based emails that are tied to a blog. We want to extend it to include transactional and mailing list based email campaigns, email and site analytics. We also want to extend the frontend capabilities to include managing these things in the studio app.

## Prerequisites

Some hoon knowledge would be a plus, but we're happy to take someone from the point of zero knowledge to being able to work on this stuff. JS/React skills would be valuable for the frontend part.

## Time Estimates

At ~10 hours per week I estimate it would take about 2 months.

## Deliverables

- A PR against this repo for the backend changes: https://github.com/tirrel-corp/studio

- A PR against this repo for the frontend changes: https://github.com/tirrel-corp/studio-ui

## Compensation

1 star upon successful completion of the apprenticeship

## Overview


The Urbit Foundation monitors existing and new issues in the codebase to identify issues that can be addressed by community contributors. 

This bounty will be awarded to someone who closes any three of the issues labeled community contribution in the [urbit](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/labels/community%20contribution) or [vere](https://github.com/urbit/vere/labels/community%20contribution) github repo. 

The ideal contributor will have a decent command of hoon and an understanding of the Urbit stack. Some, but not all, issues will require experience with the [Vere runtime](https://github.com/urbit/vere). Issues are selected to require minimal organizational context, making them amenable to open source contributors.

Please reach out to grants@urbit.org if you have any questions or would like help picking issues to work on.

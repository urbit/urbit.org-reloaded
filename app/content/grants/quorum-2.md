# Purpose #

Quorum needs many usability and accessibility improvements to make it an impactful part of the Urbit ecosystem. Its latent utility to capture and retain domain knowledge across the ecosystem has been hindered by its “minimum viable product” feature set and its existence as disjoint to Tlon’s more central Groups product (with which it overlaps on many organizational features).

The work proposed for this grant will address these issues by:
1) Extending Quorum into a custom Q&A channel type in Tlon’s Groups with the added goal of becoming a blueprint for future third-party Groups integrations.
2) Adding essential Q&A board functionalities to Quorum such as post editing, content moderation tools, and enhanced search.
3) Implementing quality of life improvements to the Quorum frontend which will make the UI more user friendly.

# User Stories #

## `%groups` User Stories ##

- As a %groups admin with %quorum installed, I can create Q&A channels in my groups, which have a name, host ship, and permissions options identical to the existing channel types (i.e. open to all, members only, or admins only).
- As a %groups admin with %quorum installed, I can modify my Q&A channels like other channel types, e.g. by renaming the channel, deleting the channel, and so forth.
- As a %groups user with %quorum installed, I can see and join Q&A channels in my groups.
- As a %groups user with %quorum installed, I can browse and manipulate the content of Q&A channels in the %groups interface.

## `%quorum` User Stories ##

- As a %quorum admin, I can remove posts from my Q&A channels.
- As a %quorum admin, I can edit the content (i.e. title, text, and tags) of any post made to my Q&A channels.

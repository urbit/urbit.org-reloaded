## Overview

Urbit Favelas at its core is a cultural onboarding art project to get new users to Urbit. The minting function we built approves any Urbit ID whether it be old or new. Thus, any Urbit ID can be typed into our form and generate a favela NFT, through the p5.js code creating the art. The Urbit ID is included in each artwork.

We are building this for users to share, swap, and collect different favelas. We come from the art world and NFT space; both Ilja and Mezzanotte have released several successful collections before. Our approach to building on Urbit was the idea to bring the unhinged normies (our audiences) on - best reason ever to get an Urbit ID: mint a favela!


## Milestones

### Milestone 1
Create the NFT collection. This is already finished, and we are gifting the grantees 1 star.

### Milestone 2

Create an Urbit app which can allow an Urbit user to claim and display their NFT. This will award an additional star.

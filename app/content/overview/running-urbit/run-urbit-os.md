Once you have acquired an Urbit ID of your chosing, you will be able to spin up your own Urbit node, or 'ship'. There are a variety of ways to do this, each with their own tradeoffs and benefits. If you are a highly technical user, running your urbit in a virtual private server (VPS) can offer streamlined networking in an execution environment you are already familiar with. If you are just trying to maximize your personal sovereignty, Native Planet offers an easy way for you to physically run your urbit in your home to truly maintain control over your data.

This call will feature a discussion by Tlon engineer Mark Staarink, also known as ~palfun-foslup, about writing an HTTP BitTorrent tracker and command line app in 1500 lines of code.

The livestream will be held on YouTube, and a group video call will be made available via Google Meet after the talk for casual discussion and in-person conversation.

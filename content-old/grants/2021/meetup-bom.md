## Urbit Meetup Open Source Bill of Materials

### Project Description

This project is for the writing and design of a bill of materials to be shared with Urbit Meetup bounty participants, for the purpose of enabling the running of initial meetup events. Additionally, it includes ongoing management of community generated content, and target audience-based versioning for key content pieces.

### Project Overview

Fundamentally, the Urbit meetups are a market and sales exercise. Now, the purpose may not be revenue for the Urbit Foundation, but rather is to bring together communities and onboard them onto the Urbit. So what I mean by marketing and sales in this context is to provide meetup bounty hunters with the persuasive narratives and content necessary to necessary to bring potential users through the process of awareness, consideration, decision, adoption, and community building. Not all potential bounty hunters will have the necessary skills to do this well--even though we may want their communities to be onboarded to Urbit. So the purpose of this project will be to enable those bounty hunters with time-saving materials and helpful guidance, so they can focus on bringing their connections and expertise, rather than hoping they can 'sell' Urbit.

### Project Scope

- The duration of this project would be from grant proposal acceptance to December 31, 2022
- Phases 1 and 2 would be deliverable based phases as listed below.
- Phase 3 would be a service provided on a quarterly basis with weekly communication and monthly repository updates.

### Detailed Description

- This grant will cover two main elements of a Bill of Materials for Urbit Meetups: Production, and Repository Management.
- Production efforts will be focused around the generation and refinement of materials that can be used by meetup bounty hunters, including the writing and design of presentations, leave behinds, and pre-meetup marketing materials.
- Repository management efforts will be focused around collation and curation of past, present, and future bounty hunter's meetup materials, audience-specific versions, and presentation videos so the knowledge and experience of the community can be accessed and disseminated ever more readily.

### Detailed Design

- After the end of Phase 1, an initial BOM will be available for future Meetup bounty hunters to use as the baseline of their meetup materials.
- At the end of Phase 2 Meetup bounty hunters should be able to easily pull down key content pieces and distribute/present them in the execution of their meetup bounty. Additionally, these bounty hunters, and the Urbit Foundation, should have clear contact point and reliable manager for a growing repository of meetup materials which can be used across a wide array of potential Urbit users.
- At the end of Phase 2, there should be a repository with two variations of meetup content for bounty hunters to choose from depending on their target audience.
- Phase 3 is a ongoing phase which may be modified as the grant work evolves, depending on the requirements of the community.

### My Experience

- 7 years running marketing agencies, doing and managing everything from video production, content strategy, and customer research, to project management, sales enablement, and content creation (whitepapers, infographics, social media ads, etc).
- I am also in the middle of a Meetup bounty myself, so I have a 'boots on the ground' understanding of the materials required, material insight into some of the questions that come from the minds of prospective Urbit users, and a view into a variety of audience types that may be interested in Urbit.

### Why I am the right person for this project

I regularly construct marketing and sales enablement materials for global technology companies for audiences of varied technical expertise and modes of processing (i.e. central vs peripheral processing). As someone who has seen the inner workings of these companies, I understand both their operational/technical shortcomings, as well as the foundational flaws in their marketing and sales practices. I can help the Urbit Foundation navigate this challenge as the Urbit story expands to more messengers and ensure Urbit does not fall victim to the same PR, corp comms, bland enablement content that it so far has avoided in things like the urbit.org documentation and blog posts.

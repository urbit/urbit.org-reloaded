_“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.”  -Antoine de Saint-Exupéry_

## Why

The core philosophy behind Urbit software is freedom and personal sovereignty in the digital age. Your data, your computation, your identity. This narrative presents a powerful marketing opportunity, as it immediately resonates with modern-day people striving against megacorp data silos, centralized censorship and behavioral data harvesting.

But we're only halfway there. To complete the circle, we must also encourage and support the use of _hardware_ that allows Urbit to run on personally owned and inexpensive small computing devices. And we need to spread this empowering narrative across the globe.

## How

Selling productized Urbit hardware devices is one effort to help complete the circle. This will eventually be achievable via customized software development ([see ~botter's Urbian project](https://grants.urbit.org/proposals/337545546)).

The other critical area of work is **Sustained Knowledge Sharing and Marketing**. We need updated documentation that helps people set up and manage their own Urbit hardware devices. And we need ongoing marketing outreach to excite and engage broader communities of people where Urbit's philosophy can be introduced, take root, and grow.

## What

-=[smol future]=- is a project to create sustained documentation and marketing efforts that will support and encourage new users to run Urbit on their own small computing devices. We will focus on Raspberry Pi to leverage its vibrant ecosystem of users, developers and integrators.

## Who

I joined Urbit in February 2020. Since then, I've cultivated the --=[ smol computers ]=-- group into an active community of ~500 members. I run two stars (~dasfeb and ~dalten) on production-quality small computing devices like Raspberry Pi and NanoPi, and I continually test new hardware configurations while documenting best practices to help others. I am prolific and adept at designing creative marketing content as well as community outreach on Twitter and other social media platforms. My personal and professional credentials are [publicly available](https://johnlester.me).

Let's do this and change the world.

## Milestones

### Initial Documentation: Beginner's Guide

1 stars
Publish a comprehensive guide on urbit.org wiki explaining how to run Urbit on a Raspberry Pi using recommended and tested hardware configurations. Walk the user through every step of of the process.

### Initial Marketing: Outreach + Messaging

1 stars
Research and outreach to engage existing Raspberry Pi users and key hardware manufacturers. Introduce the Urbit narrative into new communities, including memes/vibes.

### Sustained Documentation + Marketing: MAR

1 stars
A fire-and-forget approach will fail. To succeed and continually gain traction, both documentation (updated content) and marketing (new outreach/engagement/materials) must be sustained efforts.

### Sustained Documentation + Marketing: APR

1 stars
A fire-and-forget approach will fail. To succeed and continually gain traction, both documentation (updated content) and marketing (new outreach/engagement/materials) must be sustained efforts.

### Sustained Documentation+Marketing: MAY

1 stars
A fire-and-forget approach will fail. To succeed and continually gain traction, both documentation (updated content) and marketing (new outreach/engagement/materials) must be sustained efforts.

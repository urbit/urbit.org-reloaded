Analog to https://grants.urbit.org/proposals/1921641407-translate-key-parts-of-urbit-org-into-korean this would provide the core parts of the Documentation in German language, in order to make it more accessible to a wider audience.

Files could be sent in Markdown as PR to the urbit/docs repository or be transmitted via Email.

I am a native German speaker with a long history of speaking and writing English and currently assisting in the translation team of a worldwide operating education and development enterprise, doing both written translation as well as live interpretation.

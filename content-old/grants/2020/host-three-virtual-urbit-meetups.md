#### Background

Tlon is not Urbit; Urbit is owned by its community. So we want to decenter the Urbit brand into cities outside of San Francisco, and watch the community’s independent visions of the project take wing.

#### Bounty Description

It's the time of the Coronavirus, and so everyone is switching to meeting online. Urbit meetups can do this, too! This bounty is to host an Urbit meetup virtually. The meetup should meet the following criteria:

- The meetup must be publicly joinable, and there must be a public web link for signing up (like meetup.com)
- The meetup must have a presentation or talk about Urbit.
- The presentation or talk must be recorded and posted publicly online.
- You must promote the event vigorously; social media, a website, etc. Email support@urbit.org if you want a signal boost.
- You must host at least three virtual meetups.

You should go into this bounty with the mindset of creating a regularly scheduled meetup, one that might become the nucleus of a participatory online Urbit community. Also, email support@tlon.io once you've hosted a meetup, and we will add you to your [list of active meetups](https://urbit.org/community/meetups/)!

#### Resources

Check out our [guide](https://urbit.org/community/hosting-a-meetup/) to best practices for Urbit meetups.

#### Contribution Guidelines

- Do not begin work until your request to claim this bounty is accepted.
- When applying to work on the bounty, tell us a little about yourself and mention which city you'd be hosting the meetups in.
- Proof of the meetups happening will be determined by the recordings of the presentations. Email links to these recordings to grants@urbit.org.
- You have 100 days from the time of approval to complete this bounty.

## Milestones

## Team

_Philip_ `~wicdev-wisryt` [finished](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/1120) Aquarium, which runs a virtual fleet of ships inside a host ship, and pH, an integration testing framework. `~rigdyn-sondur` [pushed](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/1228) ncurses support. _Joe_ `~master-morzod` and _Elliot_ `~littel-ponnys` continued work on new `%eyre` (webserver) while Isaac `~novlud-padtyv` [integrated](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/1119) Landscape. Finally, `~pilfer-pandex` and _Benjamin_ `~pitmug-roptec` made progress on a reimplementation of the compiler.

Until next time.

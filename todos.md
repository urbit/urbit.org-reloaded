Notes about Blurbs
- Running urbit: Urbit is intended as a self-soveriegn networked computer, or 'personal server', that holds your data and runs on your behalf. If that sounds daunting to you, don't worry, you can have someone else run it for you. A friend, or a hosting provider such as Tlon Corporation. We would of course encourage you to learn more about how to run and operating your urbit, but if the idea of taking on that responsibility is too much right now, click this link to get seamlessly onboarded to Tlon and have them run your urbit on your behalf (you can always chose to take it and run it yourself later).

Want to get on urbit? There are a few basic options for how to get up and running, so let us know a bit about yourself and we'll point you in the right direction. Are you a developer or do you consider yourself a power user deeply interested in self-sovereignty and personal ownership of your data? In that case, you will find yourself in good company.  Whether you like learning new programming langauges, system architectures, and solving interesting computer science problems, or are just wanting to put in effort and in return regain some of the personal ownership that has been so brutally removed from our current computing experiences, we have a path for you.
  -- I want to get on urbit, but the words 'command line' or 'server' scare me, help! [route to tlon hosting]
## Technical User Decision Tree
- Urbit is under active development. Multiple organizations contribute to core development, and as an effort in rewriting networked computing from the ground up, we are regularly tackling some of the most interesting problems in compute science. If you are a developer, let us know and we'll be sure not to pull any punches in describing the technical nuances of the system.
- Urbit ID refers to the name or `@p` of your urbit computer. It is both a cryptographic identity and a network address, used for peer-to-peer communication across urbit's end-to-end encrypted network. Various options abound here, but the basic decision to make is between what technology is used as the data source for identity ownership: Azimuth or Groundwire
  - Azimuth is Urbit's original blockchain-based 'public key infrastructure'. Implemented on the Ethereum blockchain, Azimuth is a 'hierarchical and finite address space' encompassing Urbit IDs from `0` to `4.294.967.296` and providing a structure for 'sane defaults' when it comes to peer discovery, packet routing, and other services. It is also governed by the 'Galactic Senate' which handles protocol upgrades according to the logic of the Ecliptic contract on Ethereum.
  - Groundwire is an alternative identity layer that utilizes the 'comet' level address space (the 2^128 bit segment of addresses), and uses the Bitcoin blockchain for both it's 'public key infrastructure' and spam resistance (depending on economic cost of identity creation, rather than finite availability). It is free of formal governance and its development is stewarded by the Groundwire Foundation.

- Urbit OS is the 'virtual machine' that runs as a 'operating function' or 'solid state interpreter', meaning it's current state is a pure function of it's past state plus any new inputs. The entire logic of the OS is approximately 70,000 lines of code, and currently runs as a single-threaded process via a runtime interpreter. This process can be run in any number of ways, but we recommend one of the two following options for self-hosting your urbit: A Cloud VPS, or Groundseg
  - Running in a cloud VPS is a great option if you are either familiar with running remote servers, or if you would like to learn! If you are able to follow some basic CLI instructions, you'll be able to run your urbit in whatever cloud environment you are most familiar with. Running your urbit from the CLI gives you the most direct control and as a developer it can be helpful in learning the system should you want to start contributing to urbit development.
  - Alternatively, if you would like a GUI experience and a bit more of a 'hands-off' experience, we would recommend trying 'Groundseg', from Native Planet. In effect, Groundseg is a docker container orchestrator with some Urbit-savvy affordances like background runtime updates and auto-scheduling of maintenance processes. As a bonus, Native Planet sells dedicated devices purpose built to run urbit ships using Groundseg, which comes with seamless DNS support via their Startram services. We recommend Native Planet devices for those looking to run their urbit locally to maintain physical control of their data while not needing to deal with the hassles of home networking.  

## Power User Decision Tree
- Every system needs early adopters, and in return those early adopters are afforded additional latitude and capabilities. In Urbit's case, we offer you the opportunity to have a computer that is yours. that you can trust. and that is designed to last for centuries. A computer you may be able to pass down to your grandchildren. If you aren't a developer, but you do want to be a part of the process of urbit becoming a forever computer, we still want you and will gladly lend a helping hand to get you on the network.
- Urbit ID refers to cryptographically secure identity of your urbit computer. It is both a name and a network address, the way that other urbits can directly contract you, without need for a middleman. Various options abound here, but the basic decision to make is between what technology is used as the data source for identity ownership: Azimuth or Groundwire
  - Azimuth is Urbit's original blockchain-based decentralized ownership ledger and claims Urbit's ~4.3B 'short names'. Implemented on the Ethereum blockchain, Azimuth is a 'hierarchical and finite address space' designed to prevent spam while also providing sane defaults for discovering other nodes in a peer-to-peer distributed network. It is governed by the 'Galactic Senate' which handles protocol upgrades according to the logic of the Ecliptic contract on Ethereum.
  - Groundwire is an alternative identity layer that utilizes the 'comet'-level address space (the 2^128 bit segment of addresses), and uses the Bitcoin blockchain for both it's ownership ledger and spam resistance (depending on economic cost of identity creation, rather than finite availability). It is free of formal governance and its development is stewarded by the Groundwire Foundation.
    - __COMING SOON__ [button should be disabled]
- Urbit OS runs 'on top' of a traditional operating system. The entire logic and all your data lives inside your urbit, while being easily moved between hardware devices as simply as transferring a file. This agnosticism to the underlying hardware is part of the design to make it possible for your computer to last for centuries. But it does need to run _somewhere_; we recommend one of the two following options for self-hosting your urbit: A Cloud VPS, or Groundseg
  - Running in a cloud VPS (Virtual Private Server) is a great option if you are either familiar with running remote servers, or if you would like to learn! If you are able to follow some basic CLI instructions, this is a great way to learn your way around the process of running an urbit and understanding the nuances of the urbit network.
  - Alternatively, if you would like a graphical interface and a bit more of a 'hands-off' experience, we would recommend trying 'Groundseg', from Native Planet. Groundseg can run on any old computer you might have lying around and will take care of just about all the nuance of running an urbit, automagically. As a bonus, Native Planet sells dedicated devices purpose built to run urbit ships using Groundseg, which comes with seamless DNS support via their Startram services. We recommend Native Planet devices for those looking to run their urbit locally to maintain physical control of their data while not needing to deal with the hassles of home networking.

### 1. Get Port

Port is a desktop GUI application that allows you to spin up, access, and manage your Urbit ships without any knowledge of the command line or Urbit binary.

{% tab label="MacOS" %}

To install **Port** on MacOS, simply download and open the `.dmg` file.

{% button label="Download Port" link="https://github.com/urbit/port/releases/latest/download/Port.dmg" color="bg-green-400 text-white" %}
{% /button %}

{% /tab %}

{% tab label="Linux" %}

We use `snap` so that **Port** can stay updated automatically. If you already have `snap` installed, simply run:

```sh
sudo snap install port
```

Or to install `snap` for your distribution, snapcraft provides [installation instructions](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd).

{% tab label="Windows" %}

To install **Port** on Windows, simply download and open the `.exe` file.

### 2. Boot a comet

A comet serves as a temporary identity for the network. It works just fine for checking out the network, but to download applications and get the full functionality of Urbit ID you’ll need a to get a planet.

Start Port and hit the **Start without an ID** button. It'll take a few minutes to spin up the new comet.

**Want to combine the simplicity of Port with a permanent Urbit ID?**

If you already have a planet, first get your keyfile.
Start Port, click the **Boot a fresh ID** option. Give your ship a name, and in the **Shipname** field, enter your planet name, like `~sampel-palnet`. For the **Key File** field, browse to the keyfile, select it, and hit **Continue**.

Port will boot your Urbit in a few minutes!

For more information on getting a planet, see our [Getting an Urbit ID](/guides/getting-an-urbit-id) guide.

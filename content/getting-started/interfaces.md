Urbit ships by default with [Landscape](https://tlon.io), a web-based interface for managing your ship and the software installed on it, and launching other web-based applications.  However, there are many ways to interact with your Urbit.

There's [EScape](https://urbit.org/applications/~fabnev-hinmur/escape), a fork of Groups that also has an accompanying mobile application.  [Scene](https://tirrel.io/scene/index.html) and the (soon to be released) [Realm](https://www.holium.com/) offer native desktop window managers for your urbit. Lastly, there's the [Dojo](https://developers.urbit.org/overview/dojo) CLI interface for developers

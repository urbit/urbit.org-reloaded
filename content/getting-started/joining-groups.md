### 1. Get on the network

First, you’ll need to get on Urbit. You can quickly check out the network by [downloading the Port application](https://github.com/urbit/port) and booting up a comet–a temporary Urbit ID.

For long-term use, you’ll want to get a permanent Urbit ID and consider a running your urbit in the cloud or on a hosted service.

Read our [Getting Started guide](https://urbit.org/install) for details.

### 2. Open the Groups app

### 1. Select a hosting provider

Hosting providers can sell you a planet and manage the hosting for you for a regular fee. We recommend [ThirdEarth](https://third.earth/) for quickly acquiring a planet and the hosting required to make your Urbit experience accessible from anywhere.

Two important points about hosting providers:

- Because the provider has access to the resources that run your Urbit experience, you must trust them with your data.

- Urbit has portable data, so you should be able to work with a hosting provider to download all your data and boot up elsewhere if you choose to migrate or start self-hosting.

### 2. Log in

The exact steps for logging into your Urbit will depend on your hosting provider's infrastructure and the flow they've developed. If you have questions about logging into your hosted Urbit ship, contact their support.

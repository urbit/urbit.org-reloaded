Books is an application for managing your crypto wallets, transactions, and counterparties. It allows you to add your wallet and other people’s, track balances and transactions, and add private annotations to all of the above.

## Books in a Nutshell
If you spend much time interacting with crypto, you probably have a few wallets: a few hot wallets in metamask, a ledger or two, perhaps an Urbit ID on a master ticket, and that’s just Ethereum.

To get a good picture of your aggregate activity you can use a variety of chain analytics tools, but there’s always a sizable catch: there’s nowhere to record the identities of the counter parties you transact with, or the purpose of the transactions. To do this now, your options are to either keep your own records (offline), use a local-storage based address book like Metamask’s, or put your data on someone else’s servers.

Books provides an ideal solution: annotate on-chain, public information with private data stored on your urbit, your personal server. This lets you account for your spending, keep records of the people you transact with, and organize your wallets without compromising on privacy or mobility.

Urbit IDs are NFTs on Ethereum that give you access to the Urbit Network. There are a few types of Urbit IDs, but what most people will find useful is called a planet.

There are a few options to obtain planets.

## A) Ask Nicely

Some people, such as [imperceptible.computer](https://imperceptible.computer), are generously giving away planets, so if you have patience you can sign up for a free planet.

You can also ask around on Twitter or boot up a comet and ask on the Urbit network. If you get a planet this way you’ll get an email with instructions on setting it up.

## B) Buy a Planet

There are many places to buy a planet using either cryptocurrency or fiat.

Layer 1 planets are the most available through marketplaces, however they can be expensive due to Ethereum gas fees. You will need an Ethereum wallet such as Metamask to purchase these planets, and will later need to sign in to Bridge with your wallet to configure your planet.

Layer 2 planets do not require any crypto wallet management, but are at present less readily available on marketplaces.

Don’t worry, both types work the same on the network.

Here are just a few of the places where you can buy planets:

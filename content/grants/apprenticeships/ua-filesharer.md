+++

An application that allows peers to upload files to managed storage, either on or off Urbit, and share files with each other.  Can also add direct file-sharing via something like WebRTC in the future when that's ready.

### User Stories
As a user, I can:
* add custom marks to store new filetypes in Urbit
* choose a fileserver to connect to with LFS or S3 for larger binaries
* add files to my system, with metadata
* specify the users and groups that have access to my files
* view the files I have access to on other ships
* download files to my local machine

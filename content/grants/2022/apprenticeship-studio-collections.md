### Project Description

Currently %studio allows publishing groups notebook content to the web, but we would like to extend that to all the content types groups offer, with collections being the next logical step. This work will involve userspace and frontend development. It will be a solo project with mentor support.

We desire to use collections to build out 2 frontend layouts: a gallery view and
link-tree-esque "about me" page.

## Deliverables

A number of backend and frontend changes would have to be made to %studio.
- The pipe app will have to be modified to enable an additional flow type
  specific to collections, as well as whatever necessary state changes are
  required to support that
- Two instances of a new template type would have to be developed, a gallery and
  an "about me" page
- Frontend changes will have to be made according to designs we will specify, to
  expose the new functionality to %studio users

### Prerequisites

- We require apprentices to either have some experience with hoon, or at least have completed hoon school.
- React/JS experience

### Educational Outcomes for the Apprentice

By the end of the apprenticeship, the apprentice will have experience working with a mature codebase in hoon, and will have gained the practical skills necessary to analyze all the architecture and introduce large scale changes.

### Responsibilities of the Mentor

The mentor will be responsible for directing the apprentice in what changes to make, at whatever level of granularity is necessary to make progress. This can range from pair-programming where the mentor just directly tells the apprentice what to write, to guidance and suggestions for larger scale changes that the apprentice will complete on their own. As the apprenticeship progresses, the idea is to move increasingly toward the latter approach.

### Duration and Compensation

Expected duration is two months.
1 star paid at completion of apprenticeship

## UF Grant: Reduce memory usage of |meld

This project delivers massive quality-of-life improvement to urbit pilots. Our global deduplicator |meld is currently an essential tool for managing a ship, but it can require unacceptable amounts of memory. Fixing this will involve implementing yet another hashtable (most likely a HAMT), and possibly a new implementation of unifying noun equality. Martians everywhere will sing your praises.

### Deliverables

|meld without 10 GB of swap

### User Stories

Pilots are happily oblivious to the OOM killer

### Prequisites

- proficiency in C
- familiarity with immutable data structures

### Educational Outcomes for the Apprentice

The apprentice will learn about:

- vere/u3
- the loom
- unifying equality
- efficient associate memory

### Responsibilities of the Mentor

- technical direction
- code review
- release plan

### Duration and Compensation

Expected duration is two months.
1 star paid at completion of apprenticeship

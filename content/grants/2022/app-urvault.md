## Project Description

The apprentice will create a password manager UV Extension in the likes of 1Pass/Bitwarden. The extension will integrate with Urbit Visor to store user passwords encrypted on their Urbit ship, and provide an easy UX for users to add and use passwords from the extension itself.

## Prerequisites

- Experience in JS/TS
- 2+ Years Programming

## Deliverables

An initial version of the web extension which supports:

- Randomly generating new passwords
- Adding passwords to their ship
- Reading password from their ship/pasting them into password input boxes on the correct domain
- Storing passwords encrypted at rest

Payment: $12,000 in WSTR upon completion of apprenticeship at an estimated three months of work.

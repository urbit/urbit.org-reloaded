## Project Description

The project goal in short is to build native notifications into Urbit Visor.

When a user is connected to their Urbit ship via Visor, any time a new notification is triggered, then the user will see the notification inside of their browser window in the bottom right corner (akin to desktop notifications). If the user clicks on the notification, a new tab is opened and the user goes to the respective page of the notification.

This apprenticeship will also tackle implementing a notification history page inside of Urbit Visor, and potentially other extra features to make the integration sleek and easy to use such as implementing notification filtering.

## Prerequisites

- Javascript And Typescript Experience
- Interest In Urbit
- 2+ Years Programming

## Deliverables

PRs in the Urbit Visor repo implementing the native notification feature set.

1. A page to select which groups/channels send these notifications, as such a "notification filter" for Visor specifically.
2. A Visor "Notifications History" page

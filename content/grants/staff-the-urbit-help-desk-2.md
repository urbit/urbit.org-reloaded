### Background

Urbit is live. Users frequently need help. Technical issues need to be reported. This feedback process is the primary vector for refining and improving Urbit. This bounty commissions its claimant to observe and attend to these issues presently, as they arise.

### Bounty Description

The claimant of this bounty will be “staffed” to the three primary Urbit chatrooms: Discord, Urbit-Help on Dopzod, and Urbit.Live’s Telegram group. They are expected to be online at least 4 hours per day to perform the following duties:

- Help users boot ships
- Recommend relevant resources
- Troubleshoot errors users encounter using Urbit
- Observe and document bugs
- File issues to the relevant Github repo

Once per week, staff should send a weekly digest email to support@urbit.org, with a report of key events and hours worked.

Staff should periodically identify themselves and announce their presence to encourage feedback.

The bounty claimant should have competency in the following areas: Booting Urbit in terminal, Troubleshooting, Operating Urbit via the Dojo, Chat CLI, and General Urbit terminology.

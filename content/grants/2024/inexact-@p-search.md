## Description

As a phonemic encoding, `@p`'s sometimes coincide with English words, roughly or exactly. The varying intepretability of Urbit IDs enhances their collectibility and brings a certain charm to Urbit that can serve as a marketing tool. A simple interface for finding a `@p` that resembles a particular word or phrase, such as `~hinter-lander` or `~sollur-midnyt`, will help people get excited about joining the Urbit network.

A separate project has expressed desire for this functionality, as well as sigil search, fuzzy semantic search, and foreign language support including foreign script transliteration. I will create this program and publish it as an open-source Hoon library and as a static application on my website. I've already created such a program for finding exact matches of arbitrary phrases in @p substrings:

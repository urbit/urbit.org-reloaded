## Overview

Urbit is a superior development platform.  Show this to the world.  A team using Urbit’s ability to immediately deploy a server, identity system, and peer-to-peer communications will have an edge in programming competitions.

To obtain this bounty, you must:

1. Participate in a hackathon and write your submission using Urbit.
2. If you receive an award in the hackathon, we will award you a star for highlighting Urbit.

Not every hackathon will qualify, so please clear it with us first at `grants@urbit.org` or in office hours.  (Most competitions will qualify; we just want to avoid e.g. high school competitions or the like.)

This bounty may be claimed multiple times by multiple teams.

## Compensation

1 Star

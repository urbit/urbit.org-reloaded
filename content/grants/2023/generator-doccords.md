## Overview

The base desk comes with a variety of generators and threads that are useful for debugging and development. Documentation and usage guidance for these is scattered between inline comments (accessible via the `+help` generator) and [operators.urbit.org](https://operators.urbit.org/manual/os/dojo-tools) We propose to take advantage of the [newly released doccords](https://groups.google.com/a/urbit.org/g/dev/c/iqT0wgbFkPA) feature to consolidate the documentation and provide an introduction to the doccords utility for users.

## Implementation

For every "dojo tool" covered in [the docs](https://github.com/urbit/operators.urbit.org/blob/master/content/manual/os/dojo-tools.md), move the documentation into the source code in accordance with the doccord [style guide](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/develop/pkg/arvo/lib/deco.hoon).

Rewrite the `+help` generator to display the relevant doccords. 

Currently you need to do the following to see inline doccords.

```
=file -build-file %/path/to/file/hoon
# file
```

This should be improved to be:

```
+help %example-generator
> formatted comments
```

Our intention is to make a short video that can introduce Urbit to new people.

Contrasting the original [Tlon-produced explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M04AKTCDavc), we'd like to express a more subjective and personal side to using Urbit, making it understandable to less tech-inclined people in a concise and aesthetically attractive way.

~minder-folden: My work leans heavily on custom scripting for my own creative projects as well as my commissioned work for clients so I'm excited to bring that skillset to Urbit. As a primarily non-technical member of the community, I want to help communicate the value I've seen first hand on the network beyond the boundaries of the tech world. Feel free to check out [my portfolio site](https://www.jonathanpritchard.me/).

~rivpyl-sidfyl: I am experienced in video, audio and animation work.
I'll try my best in translating and adapting our idea to the audiovisual medium.
Here's a short video [reel](https://streamable.com/lpzh4s) showcasing some of my recent work.

2 stars
We publish the finalized video, after developing a working storyboard that has been reviewed and shared with people that might add relevant perspectives to the project.

Create an Airlock library for the Typescript programming language. Airlock is the set of HTTP APIs for communicating with an Urbit. This bounty will involve creating a Typescript library wrapper for the server side event and HTTP API.

Additionally, write a one-page explanation for the design choices for this library in the readme. If you have ideas for what Urbit applications would be useful for this library, please also include those suggestions in the readme.

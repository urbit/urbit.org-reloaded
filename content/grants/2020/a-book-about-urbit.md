**This grant has been completed, and the result is the novel: [The Machine War](https://store.marsreview.org/products/the-machine-war)**

I'm writing a book-length history of Urbit. I'll also write, in an Urbit-centric way, about the the wider world of computing. Chapters will be posted on Urbit, beginning October 21st, in the Notebooks section of the group ~librex-dozryc/AUC . Right now I see the piece as going something like this:

1. Preface. A short story about the year 2050. Introduction to the concept of Urbit.
2. Laundry list of the things wrong with the current internet, only more dramatic than a laundry list
3. Laundry list of the things wrong with the current internet, only more dramatic than a laundry list, continued.
4. Social history of computers
5. Social history of computers, continued
6. Technical explanation of Urbit, only more dramatic than a technical explanation
7. Technical explanation of Urbit, only more dramatic than a technical explanation, continued
8. Social history of Urbit
9. Social history of Urbit, continued
10. Summing up

I'm a novelist and essayist who has written about tech, politics, and literature. My plan, so far, for any received stars, is to spawn planets for interesting individuals and communities who might like Urbit, and to research what might go into creating a hosted star-based community.

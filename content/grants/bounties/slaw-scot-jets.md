## slaw/scot

We need to generally speed up common parsing and serialization operations. A large part of Urbit's UX is sending data in and out of Urbit for display in the UI, and the functions inside Urbit that handle this are all significant performance bottlenecks.

`slaw` parses strings to atoms, and `scot` serializes atoms to strings. They both are used heavily throughout the codebase.

Completing this bounty will have an immediate impact on the perceived speed of the system in frontends like Landscape.

### Examples
slaw
```
> `(unit @p)`(slaw %p '~pillyt')
[~ ~pillyt]
> `(unit @p)`(slaw %p '~pillam')
~
> `(unit @ux)`(slaw %ux '0x12')
[~ 0x12]
> `(unit @ux)`(slaw %ux '0b10')
```

scot
```
> `@t`(scot %p ~pillyt)
'~pillyt'
> (scot %ux 0x12)
~.0x12
```

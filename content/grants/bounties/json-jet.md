## Jet JSON Parsing/Serialization

We need to generally speed up common parsing and serialization operations. A large part of Urbit's UX is sending data in and out of Urbit for display in the UI, and the functions inside Urbit that handle this are all significant performance bottlenecks.

Urbit serializes JSON frequently when sending data to various frontends, and this would make that much more rapid.

Completing this bounty will have an immediate impact on the perceived speed of the system in frontends like Landscape.

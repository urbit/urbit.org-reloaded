#### Background

Urbit needs champions! The Urbit Foundation is looking for community members to host local or online meetups to spread the word.

#### Bounty Description

This bounty is to host an Urbit meetup in your city. The meetup should meet the following criteria:

- The meetup must be public, and there must be a public web link for joining (like meetup.com)
- The meetup must have a presentation or talk about Urbit.
- The presentation or talk must be recorded and posted publicly online.
- You must promote the event vigorously; social media, a website, etc. Email support@urbit.org if you want a signal boost.
- You must host at least two meetups.

You should go into this bounty with the mindset of creating a regularly scheduled meetup, one that might become the nucleus of your city's Urbit community. Also, email support@tlon.io once you've hosted a meetup, and we will add you to your [list of active meetups](https://urbit.org/community/meetups/)!

- Do not begin work until your request to claim this bounty is accepted.
- When applying to work on the bounty, tell us a little about yourself and mention which city you'd be hosting the meetups in.
- Proof of the meetups happening will be determined by the recordings of the presentations. Email links to these recordings to grants@urbit.org.
- You have 100 days from the time of approval to complete this bounty.

## Overview

A wealth of Urbit-centric content has been produced in the past several months, and we could use help with ensuring that it's aggregated and broadcasted to the greater community.

## Responsibilities

- Upload video content provided by Urbit Foundation and Tlon employees to the Urbit Community YouTube channel and urbit.org Media page ("channels").
- Organize content by type on YouTube, and possibly the Media page as well.
- Regularly search for Urbit-related video content and rebroadcast it from Urbit channels (with explicit permission from creators/owners).
- Upload audio-only content and add Urbit-related images as instructed by Tlon Design team.
- Keep Tlon Comms team updated when new video content is uploaded, so they can signal-boost.
- Coordinate (or even produce) video content creation from the community.
- Use Youtube as a social network to promote Urbit; link Urbit videos in the comments of video content elsewhere on YT that talks about decentralized web/web3.0, data ownership, platform failures etc.

## Requirements

- Good familiarity with video recording and editing software.
- Previous record of participation in/knowledge of Urbit Community is a plus.
- Scrupulous about checking permissions/ownership of content.

## Resources

- [Urbit YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNYIS9_SktINCC9yqO4CFZw/featured)
- [urbit.org Media Page](https://urbit.org/media/)
- The Tlon Comms team and Urbit Foundation will be available as resources for content direction, questions and feedback.

## Milestones

### Bring channels up-to-date

1 stars
Wrangle content from around the web (with creators' permission) and upload it to both channels. Provide organizational structure to content—on YouTube that's creating channels/playlists, on urbit.org it's up to you.

### Ongoing maintenance

1 stars
In the three months following the first month of work, keep an eye out for additional content and upload it as needed.

### Optional: Content creation/facilitation

1 stars
Either create or directly facilitate the creation of new video/audio content (and, of course, upload it).
